# HaPPE: Heuristic Alerts for Personal Protective Equipment
Due to forgetful or dismissive behavior, personal protective equipment is often lacking or misused
in environments that require it. To counter this behavior, a system to monitor and alert users of
their neglected PPE when entering designated regions is being developed. This system will use vision
processing to detect potentially missing PPE and trigger an alarm system to remind the user to use
correct protection.

# ToDo

* Can we license under the GPL? How much ownership does Wentworth have over this?
